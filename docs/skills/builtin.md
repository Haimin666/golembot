# Built-in Skills

GolemBot ships with two built-in skills that are automatically copied into new assistant directories during `golembot init` or `golembot onboard`.

## `general` — General Personal Assistant

A general-purpose skill that makes the agent a personal AI assistant.

**Capabilities:**
- Answer questions, provide suggestions, brainstorm ideas
- Read and write files: organize notes, generate reports, manage to-dos
- Execute scripts and commands for task automation
- Information retrieval and summarization

**Persistent Memory:**

The `general` skill establishes a `notes.md` convention for cross-session memory:

- The agent reads `notes.md` at conversation start (if it exists)
- Writes to it when the user asks to remember something, or after completing important tasks
- Organized by topic: Preferences, Project Info, To-Do
- Each entry tagged with `[YYYY-MM-DD]` date label
- To-do items use Markdown checkbox format

**Restrictions:**
- Only operates within the assistant directory
- Does not modify `golem.yaml`, `AGENTS.md`, `.golem/`, or `SKILL.md` files

## `im-adapter` — IM Response Guidelines

Optimizes the agent's responses for instant messaging platforms (Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom).

**Response length:**
- Simple questions: 1–2 sentences, max 200 characters
- Complex questions: sectioned, each section max 300 characters
- Long content: key conclusion first, then offer detailed version

**Formatting:**
- Avoid Markdown headers, code blocks, and tables (unless explicitly requested)
- Use simple list markers (1. 2. 3. or -)
- URLs directly, not Markdown link syntax

**Group chat:**
- `[User:xxx]` prefix indicates group context
- Address users by name
- Extra concise to avoid flooding

**Tone:**
- Conversational and natural
- No overly formal greetings
- Never start with "Sure, let me help you with..."

## Template Skills

| `data-analyst` | `data-analysis` | Reads from `data/`, outputs to `reports/`, uses `calc.py` |
| `code-reviewer` | `code-review` | 5-dimension review, severity tiers (Must/Should/Nice), outputs to `reviews/` |
| `ops-assistant` | `ops` | Content writing, scheduling via `schedule.md`, competitor tracking |
