# Channel Overview

GolemBot's gateway connects your assistant to IM platforms. Each platform is handled by a **channel adapter** that translates between the IM SDK and GolemBot's `assistant.chat()` API.

## Supported Channels

| Channel | Transport | Public IP Required | SDK |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| [Feishu (Lark)](/channels/feishu) | WebSocket | No | `@larksuiteoapi/node-sdk` |
| [DingTalk](/channels/dingtalk) | Stream (WebSocket) | No | `dingtalk-stream` |
| [WeCom](/channels/wecom) | Webhook HTTP | **Yes** | `@wecom/crypto` + `xml2js` |
| [Slack](/channels/slack) | Socket Mode (WebSocket) | No | `@slack/bolt` |
| [Telegram](/channels/telegram) | Long-polling | No | `grammy` |
| [Discord](/channels/discord) | Gateway WebSocket | No | `discord.js` |
| Custom | Any | Depends | Your own adapter class |

## Architecture

```
IM Platform → Channel Adapter → assistant.chat() → text response → adapter.reply()
```

The gateway:

1. Reads `channels` config from `golem.yaml`
2. Dynamically imports the SDK for each configured channel
3. Starts all adapters in parallel alongside the HTTP service
4. Routes incoming messages through session key resolution → context building → `assistant.chat()`
5. Accumulates the full text response, splits it within platform limits, and sends chunk by chunk

## Message Limits

Each platform has a maximum message length. GolemBot automatically splits long responses:

| Channel | Max length | Split behavior |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Feishu | 4,000 chars | Multi-message |
| DingTalk | 4,000 chars | Multi-message |
| WeCom | 2,048 chars | Multi-message |
| Slack | 4,000 chars | Multi-message |
| Telegram | 4,096 chars | Multi-message |
| Discord | 2,000 chars | Multi-message |
| Custom | Configurable via `maxMessageLength` | Multi-message |

## Message Format Conversion

GolemBot automatically converts standard Markdown to each platform's native format:

| Channel | Output Format | Conversion |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Feishu | Card v2 (interactive) | Native Markdown rendering — headings, lists, code blocks, tables |
| Slack | mrkdwn | `**bold**` → `*bold*`, `*italic*` → `_italic_`, links rewritten |
| Telegram | HTML | `**bold**` → `<b>`, code blocks → `<pre><code>`, blockquotes → `<blockquote>` |
| Discord | Markdown (native) | No conversion needed — Discord renders Markdown natively |
| DingTalk | Markdown (native) | Passed through as-is |
| WeCom | Plain text | Markdown stripped (WeCom text API has limited formatting) |

The AI agent is encouraged to use standard Markdown syntax (headings, lists, bold, code blocks, etc.) — each adapter handles the platform-specific conversion automatically.

## Session Routing

**DM messages** use a per-user key: `${channelType}:${chatId}:${senderId}` — each user gets their own independent conversation. The gateway injects a context line so the bot knows it's in a private conversation and who it's talking to.

**Group messages** use a shared key: `${channelType}:${chatId}` — all users in the same group share a single session, so the agent has full group context including recent message history.

## Group Chat Behaviour

Configure how the bot responds in group chats via `groupChat` in `golem.yaml`:

```yaml
groupChat:
  groupPolicy: mention-only   # mention-only (default) | smart | always
  historyLimit: 20            # recent messages injected as context
  maxTurns: 10                # max consecutive bot replies (safety valve)
```

| Policy | Agent called | When bot replies |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `mention-only` | Only on @mention | Only when @mentioned (zero cost otherwise) |
| `smart` | Every message | Agent decides — outputs `[PASS]` to stay silent |
| `always` | Every message | Every message unconditionally |

See the [Configuration guide](/guide/configuration#groupchat) for full details.

## Mention Handling

### Incoming @mentions

GolemBot strips `@` mentions from incoming messages before passing them to the agent. This handles patterns like `<at user_id="xxx">BotName</at>` (Feishu XML) and `@BotName` (plain text).

Mention detection (used for `mention-only` and `smart` policies) checks both formats and is word-boundary-aware — `@mybot` will not trigger on `@mybotplus`.

### Outgoing @mentions

When the AI reply contains `@name` patterns matching known group members, the gateway resolves them into native platform mentions. This requires the adapter to implement the optional `getGroupMembers()` method.

Currently supported:
- **Feishu** — auto-discovers group members via API, converts to native `<at>` tags in card v2 messages. Requires `im:chat:readonly` permission.
- **Slack** — fetches channel members via `conversations.members`, converts `@Name` to native `<@USER_ID>` mentions.
- **Discord** — fetches guild members, converts `@Name` to native `<@USER_ID>` mentions. Requires the **Server Members Intent** (privileged) enabled in Discord Developer Portal.

For adapters without `getGroupMembers()` (DingTalk, WeCom, Telegram), `@name` is sent as plain text.

## Quote Reply

When a user sends a message, the bot replies as a **quote reply** (referencing the original message) instead of posting a standalone message. This makes conversation threads clearer, especially in busy group chats.

| Channel | Quote Reply | Mechanism |
|---------|:-----------:|-----------|
| **Feishu** | ✅ | `im.v1.message.reply` (native quote) |
| **Telegram** | ✅ | `reply_to_message_id` parameter |
| **Slack** | ✅ | Thread reply via `thread_ts` |
| **Discord** | ✅ | Native `message.reply()` (already supported) |
| **DingTalk** | ❌ | Webhook mode doesn't support quote reply |
| **WeCom** | ❌ | API doesn't support quote reply |

No configuration needed — quote reply is enabled automatically for supported channels.

## Custom Adapters

You can connect any platform — including internal tools, custom bots, or platforms not yet built-in — by writing a simple adapter class and referencing it with `_adapter` in `golem.yaml`.

### Adapter interface

```typescript
interface ChannelAdapter {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly maxMessageLength?: number;  // optional, overrides default 4000
  start(onMessage: (msg: ChannelMessage) => void | Promise<void>): Promise<void>;
  reply(msg: ChannelMessage, text: string, options?: ReplyOptions): Promise<void>;
  stop(): Promise<void>;
  typing?(msg: ChannelMessage): Promise<void>;           // optional, send "typing…" indicator
  getGroupMembers?(chatId: string): Promise<Map<string, string>>;  // optional, for @mention support
}
```

### Writing a custom adapter

```js
// adapters/my-platform.mjs
export default class MyPlatformAdapter {
  constructor(config) {
    this.name = config.channelName ?? 'my-platform';
    this.token = config.token;
  }

  async start(onMessage) {
    // connect to your platform, call onMessage for each incoming message
    this._client = new MyPlatformClient(this.token);
    this._client.on('message', (raw) => {
      onMessage({
        channelType: 'my-platform',
        senderId: raw.userId,
        senderName: raw.userName,
        chatId: raw.roomId,
        chatType: raw.isGroup ? 'group' : 'dm',
        text: raw.content,
        raw,
      });
    });
  }

  async reply(originalMsg, text) {
    await this._client.send(originalMsg.chatId, text);
  }

  async stop() {
    await this._client.disconnect();
  }

  // Optional: show "typing…" indicator while AI is processing
  async typing(originalMsg) {
    await this._client.sendTyping(originalMsg.chatId).catch(() => {});
  }
}
```

### Registering in golem.yaml

```yaml
channels:
  my-platform:                          # any key name
    _adapter: ./adapters/my-platform.mjs  # relative path or npm package name
    channelName: my-platform              # passed as config to the constructor
    token: ${MY_PLATFORM_TOKEN}          # any other fields go to config too
```

**Path resolution:**
- Paths starting with `./` or `/` are resolved relative to the `golem.yaml` directory
- Other values are treated as npm package names and imported as-is

The adapter class must be the **default export** of the module.

### npm packages as adapters

You can also publish an adapter as an npm package and reference it by package name:

```yaml
channels:
  my-platform:
    _adapter: golembot-adapter-myplatform
    token: ${TOKEN}
```

## Image Support (Multimodal)

GolemBot supports **image messages** across all 6 built-in channels. When a user sends an image (photo, screenshot, file attachment), the adapter downloads it and passes it through the full pipeline:

```
User sends image → Adapter downloads to Buffer → gateway passes to assistant.chat()
→ image saved to .golem/images/ → file path appended to prompt → agent reads the file
→ cleanup after response
```

| Channel | Image Source | Caption/Text |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Feishu | `image` messages + inline images in `post` (rich text) | Post text content extracted |
| Slack | File attachments with image content type | Message text preserved |
| Telegram | `message.photo` (picks largest size) | `message.caption` used as text |
| Discord | `message.attachments` with image content type | Message text preserved |
| DingTalk | `picture` messages + images in `richText` | Rich text content extracted |
| WeCom | `image` messages via media API | Text set to `(image)` |

**How it works:** Images are saved as temporary files in `.golem/images/` and referenced by absolute path in the prompt. This works universally with all engines (Cursor, Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex) since every coding CLI can read local files. Files are automatically cleaned up after the agent responds.

**HTTP API:** The `POST /chat` endpoint also accepts base64-encoded images — see [HTTP API](/api/http-api#post-chat).

## Proactive Messaging (Scheduled Tasks)

Beyond responding to incoming messages, GolemBot can **proactively send messages** to IM channels on a schedule. Define tasks in `golem.yaml` and the agent will execute prompts automatically, pushing results to your IM channels.

See [Scheduled Tasks](/guide/scheduled-tasks) for full configuration, management commands, and use case examples.

## Starting the Gateway

```bash
golembot gateway --verbose
```

The `--verbose` flag enables per-channel log lines, useful for debugging.

## SDK Dependencies

Channel SDKs are **optional peer dependencies**. Install only what you need:

```bash
# Feishu
pnpm add @larksuiteoapi/node-sdk

# DingTalk
pnpm add dingtalk-stream

# WeCom
pnpm add @wecom/crypto xml2js

# Slack
pnpm add @slack/bolt

# Telegram
pnpm add grammy

# Discord
pnpm add discord.js
```

If a configured channel's SDK is not installed, the gateway will print an error with installation instructions.
